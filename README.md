# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, based on demographic and socio-economic features from the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify whether a passenger survived or not.
- **Dataset**: Titanic survival dataset from Kaggle.
- **Model**: Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Key Steps
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Missing value imputation
- Feature encoding (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
- Model training and evaluation

## 📈 Results
- **Accuracy**: 82%
- **Precision**: 85%
- **F1-Score**: 74% (Survivor class)
